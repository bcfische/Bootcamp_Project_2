Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)

For this project, our task was to "tell a story" through data visualizations. The dataset we chose was from IMDB and contained,
For each of the 22 MCU Movies, the gross revenue and screen time breakdown for each character in the movie. The first step was to
scrape the data from the IMDb website and save into a database. Then, we created a Python Flask API to handle the routing and database
inquiries. The first visualization is an interactive timeline using the 'timeknots' JavaScript library, and second are interactive
JavaScript charts allowing the user to view which characters have the most screen time, appear in the most movies, and represent the
highest average movie revenue.
